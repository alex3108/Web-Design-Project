				<h1>Welcome</h1>
				<p>This website is my way of giving back to our community. It is a work of fiction, entirely the product of my own imagination. This website is my personal opinion. To use words of Ansel Adams on page 193 of his autobiography, this site is my &quot;aggressive personal opinion,&quot; and not a &quot;logical presentation of fact.&quot;</p>
				<p>I started this website in 1999 as a way to share the photos I took each weekend with my friends. I took one free class in how to use Dreamweaver back in 1999, and that's my only formal instruction in making websites.</p>
				<p>In 2000 I started to copy my personal notes about which cameras, lenses and settings worked best for me under various conditions onto this website. I did this so that I could refer back to them from anywhere on earth, without needing to lug my computer around. I'm a photographic artist, not a computer addict. This isn't even a &quot;blog;&quot; it's just my personal website that's been growing and growing as I've been adding to it these past eleven-plus years.</p>
				<p>I never intended it this way, but search engines found this information, and somehow over the years I've become the world's largest independent source of photography information. Even the world's largest printed photography magazine has less readership than this website. Oddly, my little notes are read more than the work of any other photography author in history. Strange, but true.</p>
				<p>I was interviewed in India's largest photo magazine, Better Photography, in January 2010, who dubbed me &quot;The Opinion Maker.&quot;</p>
				<p>I feel like the Forrest Gump of photography, although unlike Forrest, in addition to having won many top awards for my artwork, and having had my work published and held in private and public collections worldwide for many decades, I have earned my living full-time in digital imaging since the 1980s. I hold a couple of US patents. Heck, even though I prefer to shoot real film for my personal work today in 2010, I've been doing this digital stuff for a full-time living for over twenty years. My dad is an engineer, so he taught us about things like discrete cosine transforms, quantization matrices and cos4 laws around the dinner table as children, thus this digital stuff has always been trivial for me. To me, understanding this technology is simply a foundation from which to create artwork, not an end to itself.</p>
				<p>Maybe I'm popular because I'm completely independent. I have no camera companies as advertisers, and I get no free cameras, or even prototypes. I say it like it is, not as a camera companies want to hear it. I've never done anything to promote this site other than to spend 12-14 hours each day adding to it, and to keep you, my reader's, long-term best interests as my only concern. This is why my pages aren't cluttered with advertisements like commercial websites; I'm trying to make this site as easy-to-read as possible.</p>
				<p>This site is accredited news media, which gives me access to press materials.</p>
				<p>I continue to do this site all by myself for fun — probably the last remaining 1990's for-fun website that hasn't sold out to other interests. Even though it has become popular, presumably because so many people find it helpful, it is still run just for fun. I am this site's only author. I have no one to proofread, spell check or fact check for me, so there will always be errors and omissions. Apparently the world finds my opinions very useful, but remember, they are the opinions of one man. I have a big sense of humor, and do this site to entertain you (and myself), as well as to inform and to educate. I occasionally weave fiction and satire into my stories to keep them interesting. I love a good hoax. Read The Museum of Hoaxes, or see their site. A hoax, like some of the things I do on this website, is done as a goof simply for the heck of it by overactive minds as a practical joke. Even Ansel Adams kidded around when he was just a pup in the 1920s by selling his photos as &quot;Parmelian Prints.&quot; I have the energy and sense of humor of a three-year old, so remember, this is a personal website, and never presented as fact. I enjoy making things up for fun, as does The Onion, and I publish them here — even on this page.</p>
				<p>I've been adding to this site since 1999. This means that many of these pages, including this one, are over ten years old. I can't possibly go back and update everything magically as the world turns. Read, enjoy, have fun, and take everything in the spirit in which it's shared.</p>
				<p>If you find any mistakes, please let me know, since there are a lot more of you than there are of me.</p>
				<p>I earn my living through this website, and have always formally and regularly registered copyright with the Library of Congress. I share this all free for the reading, and it's always appreciated when you link back to this site, but it is never permitted to copy anything.</p>
				<p>Thank you! Enjoy!</p>
				<p>Ken.</p>

				<p>How many cameras do I have?     top</p>
				<p>Three, as of July 2013.</p>
				<p>I have a Nikon D3 chained-down in my studio in Manhattan.</p>
				<p>I have a Fuji X100S for taking pictures of the kids and everything else.</p>
				<p>I still have my first dream camera, a Minolta SR-T-102 that I got for Christmas, used, in 1974, back at my mom's house.</p>
				<p>Most of the items about which I write I've borrowed from friends or readers like you, and have already returned before the review gets published. I'm at FedEx or UPS every week shipping things back.</p>
				<p>I rarely, if ever, still own any gear about which I've written. Even if I owned it when I wrote about it, this site has been on-the-air for over 13 years. I've written-up hundreds of cameras and zillions of lenses and accessories since 1999, and I certainly don't have all that here today.</p>
				<p>I'm a big returner. I'll get all excited, buy something, write it up, and if it came from a store with a good return policy, usually I'll realize a week later while the return period is still valid, that I'm never going to use it again. Back it goes, with their permission, of course. Three cameras is more than enough for anyone, especially if you have an iPhone which already has a great camera.</p>
				<p>I did have a lot of cameras up through about 2007, but as the babies arrived, more parts of the house got taken, and I gave away most of my unused cameras to charity.</p>
				<p>I started shooting with Kodak Instamatics from 1965-1972 when I was a few years old. I'd go out in the back yard and do all sorts of experiments with my telescope kits.</p>
				<p>In 1972 my parents let me use their Ricohflex medium-format TLR and light meter, all back when coupled rangefinders and FP-sync flashbulbs were innovations.</p>
				<p>I used Minolta from 1973-1983, back when through-the-lens meters were the next new thing.</p>
				<p>I bought my first Nikon, used of course, in 1983.</p>
				<p>Photography is as second nature to me as breathing. I was shooting before I could walk. I was born with it. Maybe that's why it's all so obvious to me, and why I can see through the marketing baloney so easily. Put a camera in my hand and it quickly morphs into an extension of my consciousness. A camera's job is to get out of the way of my vision, not something to have to stop and jerk around.</p>
				<p> </p>
				<p>How I Support My Family      top</p>
				<p>I've had a real job ever since I was in high school. I've worked like crazy, and made a decent living.</p>
				<p>I worked in broadcasting for decades, and saw how spending millions of dollars to make the best shows possible made billions of dollars for TV networks who gave them away free for the viewing. TV networks made these billions of dollars up in volume: advertising.</p>
				<p>I put up some ads like this one back in 2000. I'm taking those off as I make new pages or edit the old ones.</p>
